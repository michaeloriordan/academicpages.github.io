I am a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland, working with Dr. Asaf
Pe'er.  My research interests are in the area of theoretical high-energy
astrophysics, focusing on dynamical and radiative properties of relativistic,
highly-magnetized plasmas in the strong-gravity regime of accretion flows and
jets near rapidly-rotating compact objects. I am particularly interested in
understanding the mechanism by which relativistic jets are launched and
accelerated, which requires bridging the gap that exists between theoretical
dynamical models and observations.
